This Java project implements a small library reference system using a double-linked list. 
Each book is defined by a title, an author, an ISBN, and a shelf location. 
The system features a text-based user interface with menu options to allow users to enter a book, 
check if a book is in the library, retrieve information on a book, edit a book's contents 
(without changing its position in the library), delete a book from the library, print the library contents,
and exit the system. Input verification processing ensures data integrity (e.g., no numbers in the author's name, 
alphanumeric ISBN). Each book is represented by a node in the double-linked list, and new books are inserted into
the list in alphabetical order by author's last name and then by title. Additionally, the project encourages the 
inclusion of other useful functions as needed.
